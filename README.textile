h1. Rails Sample Application

This is a sample Rails application that uses Cucumber, RSpec, Factory Girl and Shoulda RSpec matchers to demonstrate the usefulness of these tools for creating a well-tested application.

h2. Installation

The following installation instructions assume you have Ruby 1.8.7 and Git installed.

* gem install rails -v 2.3.5
* git clone git://github.com/aeden/address_book.git
* cd address_book
* rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=cucumber
* rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
* rake db:migrate

h2. Running the Feature Stories

* rake cucumber
* rake spec

And if you have autotest (which I use all the time):

* AUTOFEATURE=true autospec
